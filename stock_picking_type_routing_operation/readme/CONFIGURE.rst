In Inventory Settings, you must have:

 * Storage Locations
 * Multi-Warehouses
 * Multi-Step Routes

Create an operation type and activate the "Is Zone" checkbox.
The default destination location will be the destination location
of the new operation inserted when a move has a source location which
is a child of the type's source location.
