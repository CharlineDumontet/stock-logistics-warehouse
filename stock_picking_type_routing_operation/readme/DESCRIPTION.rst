Route explains the steps you want to produce whereas the “picking zone” defines
how operations are grouped according to their final source and destination
location.

This allows for example:

* To parallelize picking operations in two main zone of a warehouse, splitting
  them in two different picking type
* To define pre-picking (wave) in some sub-zones, then roundtrip picking of the
  sub-zone waves
